## Why we need a resistor for the LED light up?

To avoid the LED from burning, we need to add a resistor to control the current in a safe rating.  
According to the LED specs, it has a voltage drop of 2 volts(from 5v to 3v) and a current rating of 20 mA.  

## Ohm's law

**V (voltage) = R (resistance) x I (current)** 
  
3v = R x 20mA

R = 3v / 20mA = 150 Ohm

So we can put a resistor with 150 Ohm or above.
